# Placeholder Video

This directory should contain a default video file named `Demo_Kiri.mp4` for fallback purposes.

You can:
1. Copy a video file from Well-V project: `/Users/yu/Well-V/public/videos/Demo_Kiri.mp4`
2. Or use any MP4 video file as a placeholder

The video will be used when MINIMAX API video generation fails or is not available.
